Visual Languages
======================

Visual Languages are in their infancy.

Similar to early textual languages, their expressive power is lacking.  Data
flow and event based languages are little more than messaging.  Block languages
like Scratch bring it a bit higher to imperative programming.

## Single Purpose

Visual languages currently exist primarily as single purpose languages.  
 * UML is good at modeling.
 * Puredata and Max/MSP for audio
 * Smalltalk Parts to wire smalltalk messages

There is a need for more general purpose languages for visual languages to advance.
